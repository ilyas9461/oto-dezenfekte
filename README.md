It is a system that was developed during the Covid-19 pandemic and can disinfect by spraying disinfectant liquid at the appropriate pressure at the entrance or exit point of any business. It is completely automatic.
 

## How it works?

It is controlled by an electronic circuit designed in accordance with the microcontroller-based embedded system architecture.

</p>


The electronic circuit detects the person, applies the spraying time, controls the status of the disinfectant liquid and notifies the situation with audible warnings. Additionally, variables related to all these operations can be adjusted via the character LCD. Setting options can be displayed on the LCD in 3 different languages: Turkish, English and French.

Additionally, a Non-Contact Thermometer device can optionally be placed on the system.
